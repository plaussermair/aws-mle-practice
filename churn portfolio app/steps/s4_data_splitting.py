    To evaluate model performance reliably on unseen data, the dataset (features `X` and target `y` derived *after* feature engineering) was split into:
    *   **Training Set (80%):** Used to train the machine learning models and tune hyperparameters.
    *   **Testing Set (20%):** Held back and used *only* for the final evaluation of the selected model(s).

    **Stratification** on the 'Churn' variable was crucial during splitting. This ensures both training and testing sets maintain the original dataset's proportion of churners vs. non-churners, which is vital for imbalanced datasets.
