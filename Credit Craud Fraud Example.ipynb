    "## Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Practical Example for ML Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This notebook demonstrates key machine learning concepts relevant to the AWS Machine Learning Associate exam and general ML practice, using a credit card fraud detection scenario. We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing between Logistic Regression and Random Forest for classification.\n",
    "* **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets (Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix).\n",
    "* **Data Preprocessing:** Feature scaling and handling class imbalance with oversampling.\n",
    "* **Overfitting and Regularization (Illustrative):** Briefly demonstrate the concept of overfitting and apply L2 regularization.\n",
    "* **Basic Hyperparameter Tuning:** Show a simple example of manual hyperparameter adjustment.\n",
    "* **Simple Ensembling:** Create a voting ensemble of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** We'll use a synthetic credit card fraud dataset created using scikit-learn's `make_classification` function to simulate an imbalanced dataset similar to real-world fraud scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to AWS and General ML:** While this example is run locally and doesn't directly use AWS services, the concepts are fundamental and directly translate to using AWS SageMaker and other ML platforms. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Algorithm Selection:** In SageMaker, you choose from built-in algorithms. Understanding when to use algorithms like Linear Learner (similar to Logistic Regression) or XGBoost (similar to Random Forest in complexity) is crucial.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics:** SageMaker Model Monitor allows you to track various metrics, including those vital for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "* **Data Preprocessing:** SageMaker Data Wrangler is designed for data preparation tasks like feature engineering and handling imbalances, mirroring the steps we'll perform manually here.\n",
    "* **Overfitting/Regularization/Tuning:** SageMaker Debugger helps identify overfitting, and SageMaker's hyperparameter tuning capabilities are essential for optimizing models.\n",
    "* **Ensembling:** You can deploy ensembles on SageMaker endpoints to improve model performance, similar to what we demonstrate with a simple voting ensemble.\n",
